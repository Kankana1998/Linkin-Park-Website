Released during the peak of the nu metal scene, the album's singles' heavy airplay on MTV led the singles "One Step Closer", "Crawling" and "In the End" all to chart highly on the US Mainstream Rock chart. The lattermost also crossed over to the nation's Billboard Hot 100.[1] Their second album, Meteora (2003), continued the band's success.The band explored experimental sounds on their third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007).

            <p class="about-content">The band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types on their fourth album, A Thousand Suns (2010), layering their music with more 
                electronic sounds. The band's fifth album, Living Things (2012), combined musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound, and their seventh album, One More Light (2017), was their first pop-oriented record.
